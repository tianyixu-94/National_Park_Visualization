I am a paleobiologist studying reptile biodiversity change through time and in response to global change phenomena, and I am also a national park enthusiast. Growing up, I love explore nature and I always get excited by the splendid wildlife and ecosystems. I especially love the US National Parks, and would go on roadtrips to visit these parks on almost every vacation. 

Here's a brief history of the US National Parks. The first national park, Yellowstone, was established in Montana and Wyoming as a public park for visitors in 1872. Later in 1916, President Woodrow Wilson started the National Park Service, which was responsible for protecting the 35 national parks and monuments then managed by the department. As of 2022, there are 63 national parks protected by the National Park Service across 30 states and two US territories. With scenic drives, wildlife and flora, hiking trails, historic sites, these national parks are enjoyed by countless domestic and international visitors every year who seek for amazing adventures in natural wonders, including me.

In this project, I am interested in investigating visitation patterns over time and biodiversity of the national parks. I created maps for national park location and biodiversity, made data visualization for visitor increase and species information, and explored correlation between national park visitor numbers and biodiversity.

Hope you enjoy reading it!
